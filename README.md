<h1 align="center"> Unity Radial Menu UI<h1>


#### This repo contains adjustable radial menu with several parameters:

* Offset
* Button Count
* Size
* Inner Radial
* Outer Radial
* Color



The radial  menu design is based on shader graphs. Therefore, no texture is included. The amount of buttons is set to be between 1 and 360 and a divisor of 360. 

### Important
The canvas Render Mode needs to be "Screen Space - Camera".

### Usage
Generate a GameObject acts like a controller. Put Menu script to it as a component. The fields become like this:
![Inspector view](/images/inspector.png "")



#### Offset

![offset variable.](/images/offsetGIF.gif "This is a sample image.")

#### Button Count
